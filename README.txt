Feature 1 - Missile speed control:
The player can adjust their missile speed across all silos using the up and down
arrow keys. The speed can range from 0.1x to 2x, where 1x is the speed obtained
by a unit vector in the direction of the clicked destination.

Feature 2 - Ammo status:
Silos only have a limited amount of ammo before they run out. This feature colors
the silos depending on the status of their ammo. When the silo is
green it has above half ammo, when it's yellow it has below half ammo, and
when it turns red it has run out of ammo.
